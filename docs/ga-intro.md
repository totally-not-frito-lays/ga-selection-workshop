# Genetic Algorithm Introduction

## Designing a GA

| GA Term           | Implementation                                              |
| ---               | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| DNA Genotype      | Vector of 100 entities that are selected                    |
| DNA Phenotype     | Each individual entity is scored differently in the matrix  |
| Fitness Function  | F(x) = w_1 * dist_from_target_ratio                         |
| Selection Style   | Probability model                                           |
| Crossover         | Combination: Coinflipping                                   |
| Mutation Rate     | 1%                                                          |
