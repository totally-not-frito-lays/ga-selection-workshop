# Visualization

When designing a visual system, it helps to plan out what it'll look like. In
this case we want to have the following:
- Current candidate pool
  - The stats of each candidate at a high level view
- Current selection with the highest combined fitness
  - Genotype: Which candidates are selected
  - Phenotype: Combined performance of the group
